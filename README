I'm starting project for my practice only. I'll use only html,css (I can also use bootstrap for this project),
Javascript for this project. 
The deadline to complete this project is by 30th september,2024.

why this project ?
1- first reason for creating this prohject is to revise whatever I have learn in Javascript,html,and css.
2- Second reason is to improve touch typing skills.
3- Third reason is to keep myself busy and happy and keep myself away from nonsense and negative things.

so, All the very best to me.
